# Map Customizer

https://map-customizer.herokuapp.com

This is a web application for displaying and customizing maps. It utilizes the Google Maps Geocoding API and the Google Maps JavaScript API. When the user submits a location, the Google Maps Geocoding API is used to get the latitude and longitude of the desired location. Once the latitude and longitude are retrieved, the Google Maps Javascript API is used to display a map of the corresponding location. The user can then choose between six different styles to apply to the map. The "Night" and "Default" styles are from the Google Maps API documentation, and the other four styles are from [Snazzy Maps](https://snazzymaps.com). This application uses JavaScript, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), and [Animate.css](https://animate.style).
